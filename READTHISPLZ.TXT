I've been trying to set up this stupid connection all day
and I can't, that's I think the biggest setback in this project.

The read in part is not terribly difficult I don't think, I've set
up a little bit of it in the server.c file


Also, we can use multiple c files in our submission according to Piazza,
we can just rename server.c or client.c to Asst3.c later
